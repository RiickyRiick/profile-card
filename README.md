## Overview

Since these design projects have been much easier for me, I've been working a lot more with @Keyframes, implementing simple float animations to images.

I've also spent a lot more time naming classes, focusing on readability and the structure of my code. However, I have been struggling with responsive font sizing, this is an area I should spend more time in. 

Overall, the design was great, and I'm proud of the progress I've been making so far.

### The challenge
